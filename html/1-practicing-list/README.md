# Practicing list

In this exercise, you will build various lists to practice HTML lists.

Create a new HTML file and complete the below exercises.
Each exercise should get a meaningful header that gives context.

## Exercise 1: Simple shopping list

Create a custom shopping list with containing at least 10 items, use unordered HTML list.

## Exercise 2: Categorised shopping list

Create another list but for now group each product into a product category. See an example below.

Hint: You don't know how to make a multilevel list? Google for it one of these keywords `nested list HTML`, `embedded list HTLM` or `multilevel list HTML`.

For example:
 - Grain
   - Flour
   - Porridge oats
   - Rice
 - Vegetables
   - Carrots
   - Aubergine
   - Batata
 - Fruits
   - Orange
   - Apple
   - Cucumber
 - Diary
   - Butter
   - Sour cream
 - Meat
   - Poultry
   - Fish

## Exercise 3: TO-DO list

Create a TO-DO list for your daily tasks using checkbox element, add as many elements as you wish but not less than 5.
Finally pick some of those tasks and set to be ticked by default indicating that has been already done.

Hints:
 - The list isn't necessary to be constructed from HTML list.
 - Use `checked` attribute to modify the default value of box.

## Exercise 4: Creating an ordered action list

Put down an ordered list of steps of how to use for example a washing machine :). Add at least 5 elements to your list using HTML ordered list.
